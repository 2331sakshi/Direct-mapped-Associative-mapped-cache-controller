# Direct-mapped-Associative-mapped-cache-controller 
VHDL code for the purpose of designing a non-pipelined processor which generates memory read/write requests to a direct-mapped and a 4 - way set associative mapped cache controller frequently, assessing their performances with reference to Cache hits versus misses.
An FSM-based cache controller has been implemented for direct-mapped as well as Four-way set-associative synchronous Cache (buffer) memory of 256 bytes whose size of the block is 128 bits or 16 bytes (by default). A multi-banked interleaved main memory system comprising of 4 memory banks of 1K byte each has been designed.
